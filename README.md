# 🚗 Automobiles Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores an **automobiles dataset** using **SQL**.  
The dataset contains detailed information about 205 cars, including specifications, technical features, and prices.  

The project covers:
- **Database schema design**  
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing**  
- **SQL queries for analysis**  
- **Insights into automobile features vs. price**

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Records:** 205 automobiles  
- **Features:** 25 attributes including technical, categorical, and numerical values  

### Key Columns:
- `make` → Car manufacturer (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Audi)  
- `fueltype` → Gas / Diesel  
- `carbody` → sedan, hatchback, convertible, etc.  
- `drivewheel` → FWD, RWD, 4WD  
- `enginesize` → Size of the engine in cc  
- `horsepower` → Power of the car engine  
- `citympg`, `highwaympg` → Fuel efficiency  
- `price` → Market price of the automobile

## 🔍 Example Analyses
- Top 10 most expensive cars
- Average price by car body type
- Average horsepower by manufacturer
- Cars with the best fuel efficiency
- Correlation between enginesize, horsepower, and price

---

## 📈 Insights
- Luxury brands (BMW, Porsche, Jaguar) dominate high-price ranges.
- Diesel cars tend to have better fuel efficiency.
- Engine size and horsepower strongly correlate with price.
